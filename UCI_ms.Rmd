Abstract
===============================================================

In urban watersheds innovative sediment management approaches have the potential to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the operations of local agencies, and help ensure salt marsh spp persistence.Future uncertainty in SLR, complex marsh dynamics, and competing habitats in the marsh make it challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of management scenarios. Here, we demonstrate a series of modeling approaches that can be applied to investigate physical changes to marshes as a result of SLR and sediment management.  We then predict the biological changes driven by the physical changes. We apply the approach at a salt marsh is southern CA which has high importance biologically and recreationally due to the massive loss of this type of habitat in the region, and highly managed sediment in the watershed and bay.
